# Working With XML and JSON in R
# Assignment Description
Pick three of your favorite books on one of your favorite subjects. At least one of the books should have more than one author. For each book, include the title, authors, and two or three other attributes that you find interesting.

Take the information that you’ve selected about these three books, and separately create three files which store the book’s information in HTML (using an html table), XML, and JSON formats (e.g. “books.html”, “books.xml”, and “books.json”). To help you better understand the different file structures, I’d prefer that you create each of these files “by hand” unless you’re already very comfortable with the file formats.

Write R code, using your packages of choice, to load the information from each of the three sources into separate R data frames. Are the three data frames identical?
Your deliverable is the three source files and the R code. If you can, package your assignment solution up into an .Rmd file and publish to rpubs.com. [This will also require finding a way to make your three text files accessible from the web].

## Data of Three Books
Three books with six attributes are selected for this assignment. A brief view of data is as below:

|Title|Author|Publisher|Year|Edition|ISBN|
|:-----------|:-------------------------|:------------|:-:|:-:|:----------:|
|Automated Data Collection with R|Simon Munzert, Christian Rubba, Peter Meißner, Dominic Nyhuis|John Wiley & Sons, Ltd|2015|1st|978-1-118-83481-7|
|Data Science for Business|Foster Provost, Tom Fawcett|O’Reilly Media, Inc|2013|1st|978-1-449-36132-7|
|Bayesian Data Analysis|Andrew Gelman, John B. Carlin, Hal S. Stern, David B. Dunson, Aki Vehtari, Donald B. Rubin|CRC Press Taylor & Francis Group|2013|3rd|978-1-4398-9820-8|

## R Packages
The following packages are used in this assignment
```{r packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(XML)
library(xml2)
library(rvest)
library(RCurl)
library(jsonlite)
```

## Create a HTML file

A HTML file is created with \<title\> 'Three Books' and a table under \<body\>. The source code is as below:
!['HTML Source Code'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielSantos33/DATA607-Assignment-8/main/HTML%20Source%20Code.png)

## Load HTML Table into R
The following actions are performed to load the HTML table into R as data frame:

  1. use get `getURL` function to extract the link of the html file.
  2. parse the html file with `read_html` function.
  3. use `html_table` function to extract a list of tables if any from the html file and convert the tables into dataframes.
  4. There is only one table in the html file, therefore the first element of the list is returned. 
  
```{r}
# HTML
url <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielSantos33/DATA607-Assignment-8/main/Three%20Books.htm')
df_HTML <- url %>%
  read_html(encoding = 'UTF-8') %>%
  html_table(header = NA, trim = TRUE) %>%
  .[[1]]

df_HTML
str(df_HTML)
```

## Create a XML file

## Load XML Table into R


```{r}
#XML 1
url <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielSantos33/DATA607-Assignment-8/main/Three%20Books.xml')
df_XML <- url %>%
  xmlParse() %>%
  xmlRoot() %>%
  xmlToDataFrame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df_XML

```

## Create a JSON file

## JSON file picture source code:
![''](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielSantos33/DATA607-Assignment-8/main/JSON%20Source%20Code.png)

## Load JSON table into R

  1. Parse JSON into R as a list called `df_JSON`
  2. Convert `df_JSON` to dataframe
  3. reanme columns, removing prefix 'three.books.'
  4. The column `Author` contains lists of names of authors of each book, therefore concatename those names in each list as one single string in order to fit into column 'Author'.
```{r}
#json
url <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrielSantos33/DATA607-Assignment-8/main/Three%20Books.json")
df_JSON <- url %>%
  fromJSON() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rename_all(funs(str_replace(., 'three\\.books\\.',''))) %>%
  mutate(Author = unlist(lapply(Author, function(x) str_c(x, collapse = ', '))))

df_JSON
str(df_JSON)

```


# Are the three data frames identical?
No,these three dataframes are almost identical. There are only minor differences while parsing numeric values from source file to R dataframe.

1. `df_HTML` Vs `df_XML`

The only difference is the data type of column `Year`. The `html_table` function from package `rvest` automatically parses numbers as numerical values, while the `xmlToDataFrame` function from package `XML` converts all values to characters if argument `stringsAsFactors` = FALSE. The two dataframes are identical if the data type of column `Year` in `df_XML` is converted to integer.
```{r HTML VS XML}
all.equal(df_HTML,df_XML)
all.equal(df_HTML$Year, as.integer(df_XML$Year))
```

2. `df_HTML` Vs `df_JSON`

The two dataframes are identical. both `html_table` function from package `rvest` and `fromJSON` from package `jsonlite` are robust enough to parse values in appropriate data types.
```{r HTML VS JSON}
all.equal(df_HTML,df_JSON)
```

3. `df_XML` Vs `df_JSON`

The two dataframes are almost identical. The `xmlToDataFrame` function from package `XML` converts data type of numbers as characters if argument `stringsAsFactors` = FALSE, while the `fromJSON` from package `jsonlite` parses numbers as numerical values. The two dataframes are identical if the data type of column `Year` in `df_XML` is converted to integer.
```{r XML VS JSON}
all.equal(df_XML,df_JSON)
all.equal(as.integer(df_XML$Year), df_JSON$Year)
```
